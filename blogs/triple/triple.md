If you’ve been around Bittensor, you’ve likely seen a lot of innovation—but much of it has felt experimental, almost like ongoing R&D with yet-to-be-realized potential. Now, things are shifting. At a recent [Novelty Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZWA3VmSIfU), some of the core ecosystem contributors brought forward a trio of tangible upgrades that push Bittensor beyond the prototype phase and into a more practical, developer-friendly era. By delivering real-world tools—faster inference through NineteenAI, accessible training with Gradients, and serverless compute via Chutes— Bittensor participants are showing that Bittensor isn’t just a hub for ideas, but a growing marketplace of capabilities ready to be put to use.

## SN19’s Blazing Fast Inference

[NineteenAI](https://nineteen.ai/), a subnet within the Bittensor network dedicated to AI inference, has received a significant upgrade. The [Rayon Lab’s](https://rayonlabs.ai/) team’s refinements have positioned NineteenAI to outperform almost every Web2 provider, even those armed with custom hardware like Groq, particularly when it comes to scaling and serving more users. According to [Nam](https://x.com/namoray_dev), one of the lead developers, NineteenAI now hits over 300 tokens per second (image below) on Llama models—making it one of the fastest inference stacks around.

The secret? Miners within NineteenAI have gone all-in on optimization. They’ve refined scheduler steps, leveraged high-performance GPUs like the H100 SXM5, and employed countless under-the-hood tweaks. As Jon Durbin, a top miner, noted in the Novelty Search event, “There are also trade secrets that save milliseconds, and we’re not going to share those.” It’s a reminder that Bittensor’s economy pushes participants to get smarter, leaner, and faster, benefiting everyone who taps into the network.

## Gradients: Making AI Training Accessible to Everyone

If high-speed inference broadens what you can do, Gradients makes it simpler for anyone to start doing it. No more grappling with exotic compute clusters or advanced ML theory—Gradients lets you pick a model, choose a dataset (even from Hugging Face), and set your training hours.

Behind the scenes, miners compete to deliver the best training results, optimizing hyperparameters and employing advanced techniques to improve model performance. This competitive environment not only ensures high-quality models but also pushes the boundaries of automated machine learning (AutoML). As Wandering Weights from [Rayon Lab’s](https://rayonlabs.ai/) explained in the Novelty Search, "We want to incentivize miners to come up with automatic scripts that can very quickly determine which hyperparameters are required to solve a particular problem."

## Chutes: Serverless Compute Ready to Challenge the Big Players

Finally, [Namoray](https://x.com/namoray_dev) introduced [Chutes](https://chutes.ai/), a serverless compute platform that rivals centralized solutions like AWS Lambda—but built atop decentralized infrastructure and optimized for GPUs. Whether you need arbitrary Docker containers or specialized AI workloads, Chutes unlocks the ability to run code at scale, on-demand, using miners’ hardware.

Of course, bringing serverless compute to a decentralized environment isn’t trivial. Validation and correct task execution are top of mind. Jon and Namorray have engineered an intricate validation system involving encrypted challenges and hardware verification. This ensures miners are doing exactly what they claim and provides users with confidence that the platform is reliable enough for serious production-grade tasks.

## Why This Matters

Until now, Bittensor often felt like an ecosystem rich in imagination but short on turnkey solutions. With NineteenAI, Gradients, and Chutes, the Rayon Lab’s team shows that decentralized AI can be both cutting-edge and usable. Fast inference, accessible training, and reliable compute aren’t just buzzwords—they’re real features that developers and businesses can tap into.

For those building new applications, this means leveraging Bittensor’s network for high-speed model serving, streamlined model training, and flexible, serverless compute. And all of this is backed by the blockchain’s security and decentralization, making it more than a theoretical playground—it’s evolving into a mature platform ready to handle real workloads.

## Development Hurdles

Will everything run perfectly from the start? Probably not. Challenges remain, particularly around validation and incentive structures. Yet, these solutions mark a turning point. Bittensor is no longer just a concept—it’s becoming a place where teams can deliver actual tools that push decentralized AI into its next chapter.

The future isn’t just bright—it’s more practical, more accessible, and increasingly competitive. In other words, Bittensor is growing up, and that means there’s never been a better time to plug in and see what it can do.
