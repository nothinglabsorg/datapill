# **Dynamic TAO: Bringing Bittensor out of the Dark Age**
**Author: Sami Kassab, Alex Kirk**



Today, $4.2 million worth of TAO emissions will be minted. If the current price holds, over the next year, $1.5 billion of TAO will flow to subnets and their contributors. The critical decisions on how these emissions are allocated are made by a group of the largest validators, essentially resembling a DAO. And let's be real - anyone who's been in crypto for more than 48 hours knows that DAOs are pretty ineffective at accomplishing large, long-term tasks.


## Root Network Era

The Root Network consists of 64 of the largest validators tasked with voting on how protocol emissions should flow to specific subnets. Here's the kicker: the top seven validators control 67% of the staked circulating TAO supply. So basically 7 people are essentially steering emissions for the entire protocol, which has led to several issues like:

-   Insider deals between subnet owners and large validators for emissions, undermining network integrity
    
-   Zero accountability for poor allocation decisions
    
-   Inefficient decision-making since many validators lack AI expertise

## **Dynamic TAO Era**

But fear note, because Dynamic TAO (dTAO) —the solution that'll take Bittensor out of the dark ages— is on the horizon. Looking back, we'll view the Root Network era as a temporary solution that helped bootstrap the network while a more efficient capital allocation system was developed.

Instead of validators making consequence-free votes, dTAO transitions to a market-based system where each subnet has its own token. The relative price of these tokens determines emission allocation to subnets. As markets digest new information and revalue subnets, emissions dynamically adjust.

Without diving into the nitty-gritty (check out the details [here](https://medium.com/@unconst/bit001-dynamic-tao-8ddc7a26dd62)), each subnet will have an embedded liquidity pool with TAO on one side and the subnet token on the other. To get subnet tokens, you stake TAO in the pool. When doing this, you're essentially betting that future TAO in the subnet's liquidity pool will increase, letting you swap the subnet tokens you got for more TAO than you put in. This forces investors and validators to actually do their homework on subnets they support - because now there are real consequences for poor decisions.

## **sTAO in the Meantime**

While waiting for dTAO, the community has implemented solutions like sTAO in an attempt to solve some of the existing problems and democratize emission distribution. Platforms by [Datura](https://datura.ai/validator), [Miners Union](https://www.minersunion.ai/), and [Manifold Labs](https://youtu.be/IYhbTgEY7h8?si=tGHLXDqUNnQZmIJo&t=2250) let any TAO holder participate in voting. But to be honest - it's mostly subnet owners voting for their own subnets (lol). Not exactly a long-term solution.

## Looking Ahead

Will the first implementation of Dynamic TAO be perfect? Likely not. Market manipulation and initial volatility are real risks. But it's a massive step toward solving the resource allocation problem.

The Bittensor foundation aims to implement Dynamic TAO by year-end, though Q1 2025 is probably more realistic. A bet on Bittensor is essentially a bet that the foundation and community will keep refining this mechanism to reward value-producing subnets.

Dynamic TAO could kickstart an AI renaissance within Bittensor. With the subnet cap likely removed, expect a Cambrian explosion of subnets and experiments. Adding tokens to each subnet will create an AI casino - and if there's one thing we know about crypto folks, it's that they love to speculate.
