# The Controversy of Bittensor's Future with EVM Compatibility
 ***Written by:*** ***[Alex](https://x.com/AlexKiriakides) and [Sami](https://x.com/Old_Samster)***

Bittensor's current architecture is intentionally simple: subnet owners create incentive mechanisms that direct validators and miners toward specific goals. While this design is powerful for its intended purpose of producing commodities, the network lacks the programmability of traditional Layer-1s – meaning no smart contracts or complex onchain applications. But with EVM support on the horizon, Bittensor is poised to dramatically expand its capabilities beyond its current scope.

### The Announcement

Last October, the OpenTensor Foundation [announced](https://x.com/opentensor/status/1847035817048387961) a proposal to implement the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) into the Bittensor network. In simple terms, this would allow developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts directly on Bittensor's blockchain without any modifications. This move has sparked both excitement and controversy within the community.

### What This Enables

Thanks to its substrate-based blockchain architecture, Bittensor can incorporate the EVM pallet—a modular component borrowed from an existing Polkadot project, Moonbeam. Think of these pallets as Lego pieces that can be snapped onto the blockchain, adding new functionalities with relative ease.

Here's what EVM compatibility brings to the table:

1.  Expanded Application Ecosystem: Existing Ethereum applications and new smart contracts could now be deployed on Bittensor. This opens the door for DEXs, lending platforms, stablecoins, and more. Think of a trustless app that allows miners to borrow on their TAO to rent mining hardware, where the loan is automatically paid back using the miner’s earnings.
    
2.  Enhanced Interoperability and Custody Solutions: EVM integration facilitates trustless bridging with other blockchains, making it easier to move assets between networks. It also enables more sophisticated custody solutions and complex account structures, appealing to organizations and institutions that require advanced security and management features. Basically, this would help number go up.
    
3.  Advanced Subnet Mechanisms: Perhaps most intriguingly, EVM support allows for more complex incentive mechanisms within subnets. Subnet owners can design intricate reward systems, including features like slashing for underperforming miners or validators.
    

### Community Reactions

As with any significant change, the announcement stirred a spectrum of reactions:

-   The Excited Camp: Many are thrilled about the new possibilities. They see EVM integration as a step towards more innovation, utility, and growth. The ability to create more complex architectures is a boon for developers eager to push the boundaries.
    
-   The Concerned Camp: On the other hand, some community members are worried. They fear that introducing EVM could dilute Bittensor's original vision of focusing solely on producing commodities. There's apprehension that the network might become cluttered with crypto applications that don't align with its core mission. Specifically, they don't want meme coins or the "degen" side of crypto flooding into Bittensor, potentially undermining the network's integrity.
    

### The Middle Ground: Senate Approval

Acknowledging the concerns, OTF proposed a [compromise](https://youtu.be/CPGdkcN-7So?si=9RmbCkxLI8m39Fhv) to ensure that Bittensor doesn't lose its way:

-   Permissioned Smart Contracts: Instead of allowing anyone to deploy any contract, all new smart contracts would require approval from the Senate—a governing body within Bittensor.
    
-   Quality Control: This gatekeeping mechanism aims to prevent an influx of low-quality or harmful projects (think scam tokens and pointless meme coins) from cluttering the network.
    
-   Balancing Innovation and Integrity: By vetting contracts, Bittensor can enjoy the benefits of EVM integration while preserving its foundational goals.
    

### Looking Ahead

This debate isn't unique to Bittensor. It's reminiscent of the discussions within the early Bitcoin community, where some advocated for keeping things as they were, while others pushed for added functionalities like smart contracts or larger block sizes. Change often brings discomfort, but it's also a driver of growth.

By continuing to innovate at a rapid pace, Bittensor can maintain its competitive edge. Getting too comfortable or fearing change is how projects lose relevance and get surpassed by competitors. The only true moat a project has is its ability to evolve.
