taoshi-trading-alpha-on-bittensor,Taoshi: Trading Alpha on Bittensor,"Taoshi's Proprietary Trading Network, better known as Bittensor subnet 8, is a decentralized platform where trading and machine learning professionals compete to provide institutional-grade trading signals across forex, stock indices, and crypto assets. The subnet operates as a continuous, transparent proprietary trading competition, rewarding contributors for producing competitive trading signals, while making these insights accessible to all.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/taoshi-report-2/thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/taoshi-report-2/report.md
dynamic-tao-bringing-bittensor-out-of-the-dark-age,Dynamic TAO: Bringing Bittensor out of the Dark Age,"Today, $4.2 million worth of TAO emissions will be minted. If the current price holds, over the next year, $1.5 billion of TAO will flow to subnets and their contributors. The critical decisions on how these emissions are allocated are made by a group of the largest validators, essentially resembling a DAO. And let's be real - anyone who's been in crypto for more than 48 hours knows that DAOs are pretty ineffective at accomplishing large, long-term tasks.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/dtao-report/thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/dtao-report/report.md
the-controversy-of-bittensors-future-with-evm-compatibility,The Controversy of Bittensor's Future with EVM Compatibility,"Bittensor's current architecture is intentionally simple: subnet owners create incentive mechanisms that direct validators and miners toward specific goals. While this design is powerful for its intended purpose of producing commodities, the network lacks the programmability of traditional Layer-1s â€“ meaning no smart contracts or complex onchain applications. But with EVM support on the horizon, Bittensor is poised to dramatically expand its capabilities beyond its current scope.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/EVM/EVM_thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/EVM/EVM.md
