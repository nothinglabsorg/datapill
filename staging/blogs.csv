fast-inference-easy-fine-tuning-and-reliable-serverless-compute,"Fast Inference, Easy Fine-tuning, Reliable Serverless Compute","If you’ve been around Bittensor, you’ve likely seen a lot of innovation—but much of it has felt experimental, almost like ongoing R&D with yet-to-be-realized potential. Now, things are shifting. At a recent Novelty Search, some of the core ecosystem contributors brought forward a trio of tangible upgrades that push Bittensor beyond the prototype phase and into a more practical, developer-friendly era. By delivering real-world tools—faster inference through NineteenAI, accessible training with Gradients, and serverless compute via Chutes— Bittensor participants are showing that Bittensor isn’t just a hub for ideas, but a growing marketplace of capabilities ready to be put to use.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/triple/triple1.png,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/triple/triple.md
tao360-revolutionizing-how-we-evaluate-subnets,Tao360: Revolutionizing How We Evaluate Subnets,"Tao360 introduces AI-powered analytics to evaluate Bittensor subnets and guide emissions allocation. The platform aggregates data from GitHub, social media, and network metrics, processing them through multiple AI models to assess subnet performance. In a recent analysis of 2,350+ reports, Tao360 demonstrated how data-driven insights could transform network governance, despite current limitations in social validation and benchmarking.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/tao360-report/thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/tao360-report/report.md
the-controversy-of-bittensors-future-with-evm-compatibility,The Controversy of Bittensor's Future with EVM Compatibility,"Bittensor's current architecture is intentionally simple: subnet owners create incentive mechanisms that direct validators and miners toward specific goals. While this design is powerful for its intended purpose of producing commodities, the network lacks the programmability of traditional Layer-1s – meaning no smart contracts or complex onchain applications. But with EVM support on the horizon, Bittensor is poised to dramatically expand its capabilities beyond its current scope.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/evm/evmpic.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/EVM/EVM.md
dynamic-tao-bringing-bittensor-out-of-the-dark-age,Dynamic TAO: Bringing Bittensor out of the Dark Age,"Today, $4.2 million worth of TAO emissions will be minted. If the current price holds, over the next year, $1.5 billion of TAO will flow to subnets and their contributors. The critical decisions on how these emissions are allocated are made by a group of the largest validators, essentially resembling a DAO. And let's be real - anyone who's been in crypto for more than 48 hours knows that DAOs are pretty ineffective at accomplishing large, long-term tasks.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/dtao-report/thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/dtao-report/report.md
taoshi-trading-alpha-on-bittensor,Taoshi: Trading Alpha on Bittensor,"Taoshi's Proprietary Trading Network, better known as Bittensor subnet 8, is a decentralized platform where trading and machine learning professionals compete to provide institutional-grade trading signals across forex, stock indices, and crypto assets. The subnet operates as a continuous, transparent proprietary trading competition, rewarding contributors for producing competitive trading signals, while making these insights accessible to all.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/taoshi-report-2/thumbnail.jpg,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nothinglabsorg/datapill/refs/heads/main/blogs/taoshi-report-2/report.md
